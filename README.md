A project I worked on back in sophomore year for an end-of-the-year gallery assignment. We were told to use the programming skills we used throughout the year to create an artifact in Java. That artifact could have been anything from a Java graphics drawing or a complex mad-lib. I decided to take it upon myself to try making a small game, a classic single player version of pong would suffice. This was completed in three days and I'm posting it here so that it serves as a memento to everything I learned in my first CS class.
